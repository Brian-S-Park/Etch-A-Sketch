# Etch-A-Sketch Project
A game based on the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy using html, css, and javascript from theodnproject.com as part of the foundations course. My goal was to create a visually pleasing experience while also capturing the joy of playing with an etch-a-sketch toy. This project taught me a lot about DOM manipulation in javascript and how to research subjects that are completely new to me. I had a really great experience figuring out how to tackle each problem and it was very gratifying when I did. Thanks for checking out my project!
